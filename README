WHAT IS THIS?

Algorithm::SixDegrees is an implementation of a simple algorithm
to find a link between interconnected elements in a known set.

Another way of explaining this would be that this module, given
a list of all actors and movies, could help determine an answer
for the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.

REQUIREMENTS

I have developed this module for use with Perl 5.6.1 and above.
Other than that, it has no external dependencies.

SAMPLES

There are some samples in the F<samples/> directory; they will
require some preparation work to be usable.  Check the scripts
before running them for all the details.  These do have other
dependencies that you will have to satisfy before execution.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
